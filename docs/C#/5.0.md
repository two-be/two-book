C# 5.0, released with .NET Framework 4.5 in August 2012, focused primarily on asynchronous programming and improving the performance of applications that perform I/O-bound or CPU-bound operations. Here are the key features introduced in C# 5.0, along with examples and comparisons to earlier versions of C#:

### 1. **Async/Await**
The `async` and `await` keywords were introduced to simplify writing asynchronous code, making it more readable and maintainable by avoiding callback "pyramids of doom" and making asynchronous code appear more like its synchronous counterpart.

**C# 5.0**
```csharp
public async Task<string> GetWebPageAsync(string url)
{
    using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
    {
        string content = await client.GetStringAsync(url);
        return content;
    }
}
```
This method asynchronously downloads the content of a web page, and the `await` keyword is used to await the completion of the asynchronous operation without blocking the calling thread.

**C# < 5.0**
Before C# 5.0, asynchronous programming involved more complex patterns, such as the use of callbacks, the `IAsyncResult` pattern, or the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP).
```csharp
public void GetWebPage(string url, Action<string> callback)
{
    WebClient client = new WebClient();
    client.DownloadStringCompleted += (sender, e) =>
    {
        if (e.Error == null)
        {
            callback(e.Result);
        }
    };
    client.DownloadStringAsync(new Uri(url));
}
```
This approach is more cumbersome and harder to read, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.

### 2. **Caller Information Attributes**
C# 5.0 introduced Caller Information attributes (`CallerFilePath`, `CallerLineNumber`, `CallerMemberName`) that allow you to obtain information about the caller of a method, which is particularly useful for diagnostic purposes.

**C# 5.0**
```csharp
public void LogMessage(string message,
    [CallerMemberName] string memberName = "",
    [CallerFilePath] string filePath = "",
    [CallerLineNumber] int lineNumber = 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{filePath}({lineNumber}) {memberName}: {message}");
}
```
This method logs a message along with information about the caller, without the caller needing to supply this information explicitly.

**C# < 5.0**
In earlier versions, obtaining caller information required manual input, such as passing the file name, line number, and member name as parameters, making logging and diagnostics more tedious and error-prone.

```csharp
public void LogMessage(string message, string memberName, string filePath, int lineNumber)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{filePath}({lineNumber}) {memberName}: {message}");
}
// Usage (manual and prone to errors)
LogMessage("An error occurred.", nameof(MyMethod), "MyFile.cs", 42);
```
