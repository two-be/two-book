C# 1.0, released in 2002 as part of Microsoft's .NET initiative, introduced a wide range of features designed to combine the power and flexibility of C++ with the simplicity of Visual Basic. Here are some of the key features of C# 1.0 along with examples for each:

### 1. **Strong Typing**
C# is a strongly-typed language, meaning that every variable and object instance must have a declared type.

```csharp
int number = 5;  // 'number' is explicitly defined as an integer
```

### 2. **Object-Oriented**
Everything in C# is associated with classes and objects, along with their attributes and methods.

```csharp
class Person {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public void Introduce() {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hi, my name is {Name}");
    }
}

Person person = new Person();
person.Name = "John";
person.Introduce();  // Output: "Hi, my name is John"
```

### 3. **Automatic Memory Management**
C# uses garbage collection to automatically manage memory, eliminating the need to manually release memory.

```csharp
// Memory allocation
Person person = new Person();

// Memory is automatically reclaimed by the garbage collector when 'person' is no longer in use.
```

### 4. **Properties**
Properties provide a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the values of private fields.

```csharp
class Person {
    private string name;
    public string Name {
        get { return name; }
        set { name = value; }
    }
}
```

### 5. **Events and Delegates**
C# supports events and delegates, enabling a way to provide event handling.

```csharp
public delegate void EventHandler(string message);

class EventDemo {
    public event EventHandler OnChange;

    public void Change(string message) {
        if (OnChange != null) {
            OnChange(message);
        }
    }
}

EventDemo demo = new EventDemo();
demo.OnChange += (message) => Console.WriteLine(message);
demo.Change("Event triggered");  // Output: "Event triggered"
```

### 6. **Versioning**
C# includes features such as assemblies and strong names to provide versioning control.

```csharp
// Assemblies can be given strong names to ensure that applications reference the correct version of a library.
```

### 7. **Error Handling with Exceptions**
C# uses structured exception handling, based on try, catch, and finally blocks.

```csharp
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
    int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
    Console.WriteLine(numbers[3]);  // This will throw an IndexOutOfRangeException
} catch (IndexOutOfRangeException e) {
    Console.WriteLine("An exception occurred: " + e.Message);
} finally {
    // Code to execute after try/catch, regardless of an exception
    Console.WriteLine("Finally block executed");
}
```

### 8. **Array**
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

```csharp
int[] numbers = new int[5] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // Declaring and initializing an array
Console.WriteLine(numbers[0]);  // Accessing the first element of the array
```
