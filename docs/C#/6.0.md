C# 6.0, released with .NET Framework 4.6 in July 2015, introduced several syntactic sugar features that made the language more concise and expressive. These features helped reduce boilerplate code and made certain patterns more readable. Here are some of the key features introduced in C# 6.0, along with examples and comparisons to earlier versions of C#:

### 1. **String Interpolation**
String interpolation allows you to embed expressions directly within string literals using the `$` character, making the creation of formatted strings more readable.

**C# 6.0**
```csharp
var name = "Alice";
var greeting = $"Hello, {name}!";
Console.WriteLine(greeting);  // Output: "Hello, Alice!"
```

**C# < 6.0**
Previously, you had to use `string.Format`, concatenation, or other methods to compose strings, which was less readable.
```csharp
var name = "Alice";
var greeting = string.Format("Hello, {0}!", name);
// or
var greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!";
Console.WriteLine(greeting);
```

### 2. **Null-conditional Operators (`?.` and `?[]`)**
Null-conditional operators allow you to safely access members and elements of an object that might be `null`, reducing the amount of code needed for null checks.

**C# 6.0**
```csharp
string[] array = null;
var length = array?.Length;  // No NullReferenceException, 'length' will be null
Console.WriteLine(length);  // Output: ""
```

**C# < 6.0**
Before C# 6.0, you had to explicitly check for `null` to avoid `NullReferenceException`.
```csharp
string[] array = null;
var length = (array != null) ? array.Length : (int?)null;
Console.WriteLine(length);
```

### 3. **Expression-bodied Members**
Expression-bodied members allow properties, methods, and read-only properties to have their bodies defined as an expression, making the syntax more concise for simple implementations.

**C# 6.0**
```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string FullName => $"{FirstName} {LastName}";
}
```

**C# < 6.0**
Previously, even simple properties or methods required a full body with a `return` statement.
```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string FullName
    {
        get { return FirstName + " " + LastName; }
    }
}
```

### 4. **Auto-property Initializers**
Auto-property initializers allow you to directly initialize auto-implemented properties at their declaration point, simplifying the initialization of properties.

**C# 6.0**
```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = "Unknown";
}
```

**C# < 6.0**
Before C# 6.0, property initialization required a constructor or field initialization.
```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Person()
    {
        Name = "Unknown";
    }
}
```

### 5. **Nameof Expressions**
The `nameof` operator provides a safe way to obtain the name of a variable, type, or member as a string, making your code more refactor-safe.

**C# 6.0**
```csharp
public void NotifyPropertyChanged(string propertyName)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Property changed: {propertyName}");
}

NotifyPropertyChanged(nameof(Name));
```

**C# < 6.0**
Previously, you had to use string literals, which could lead to errors during refactoring.
```csharp
public void NotifyPropertyChanged(string propertyName)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Property changed: {propertyName}");
}

NotifyPropertyChanged("Name");
```
