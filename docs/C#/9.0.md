C# 9.0, released with .NET 5 in November 2020, introduced several new features aimed at making the language more concise, expressive, and efficient for modern development practices. Here are some of the key features introduced in C# 9.0, along with examples and comparisons to earlier versions of C#:

### 1. **Records**
Records are a reference type that provides built-in functionality for encapsulating immutable data. They are ideal for scenarios where the primary purpose of the type is to store data with little to no behavior.

**C# 9.0**
```csharp
public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);
```

**C# < 9.0**
Before C# 9.0, creating an immutable class required more boilerplate code, including manually implementing value equality.
```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; }
    public string LastName { get; }

    public Person(string firstName, string lastName) => (FirstName, LastName) = (firstName, lastName);

    protected bool Equals(Person other) => FirstName == other.FirstName && LastName == other.LastName;

    public override bool Equals(object obj)
    {
        if (ReferenceEquals(null, obj)) return false;
        if (ReferenceEquals(this, obj)) return true;
        if (obj.GetType() != this.GetType()) return false;
        return Equals((Person)obj);
    }

    public override int GetHashCode() => HashCode.Combine(FirstName, LastName);
}
```

### 2. **Init Only Setters**
Init only setters provide a way to make individual properties immutable after object construction, enhancing the support for immutable data types in C#.

**C# 9.0**
```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; init; }
    public string LastName { get; init; }
}

var person = new Person { FirstName = "John", LastName = "Doe" };
// person.FirstName = "Jane"; // Error: Init-only property or indexer 'Person.FirstName' can only be assigned in an object initializer
```

**C# < 9.0**
Previously, to achieve immutability for individual properties, you had to use readonly fields or properties with private setters, which could only be set in the constructor.
```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; private set; }
    public string LastName { get; private set; }

    public Person(string firstName, string lastName)
    {
        FirstName = firstName;
        LastName = lastName;
    }
}
```

### 3. **Top-level Statements**
Top-level statements reduce the boilerplate code required for simple programs, allowing you to write the main body of a program without the need for a `Main` method.

**C# 9.0**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

**C# < 9.0**
In earlier versions, a `Main` method was required as an entry point for every console application.
```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### 4. **Pattern Matching Enhancements**
C# 9.0 introduced new pattern matching capabilities, such as simple type patterns, relational patterns, and logical patterns, making pattern matching more expressive and powerful.

**C# 9.0**
```csharp
public static string GetDescription(object obj) => obj switch
{
    > 0 and < 10 => "Between 0 and 10",
    string s => $"String of length {s.Length}",
    null => "Null",
    _ => "Unknown"
};
```

**C# < 9.0**
Pattern matching was less expressive, and certain patterns required more verbose code or were not possible.
```csharp
public static string GetDescription(object obj)
{
    if (obj is int i && i > 0 && i < 10)
    {
        return "Between 0 and 10";
    }
    else if (obj is string s)
    {
        return $"String of length {s.Length}";
    }
    else if (obj == null)
    {
        return "Null";
    }
    else
    {
        return "Unknown";
    }
}
```

### 5. **Target-typed `new` Expressions**
C# 9.0 allows the type of the `new` expression to be inferred from the context, reducing redundancy when the type is already known.

**C# 9.0**
```csharp
Person person = new("John", "Doe");
```

**C# < 9.0**
Previously, you had to specify the type explicitly for each `new` expression.
```csharp
Person person = new Person("John", "Doe");
```
